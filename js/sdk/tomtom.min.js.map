It can be\n *     overwritten with the `tomtom.key()` method globally or per service  with `tomtom.<service_name>.key()` functions.\n *     It is also possible to pass a specific key while working with instances of the services.\n * @param {\"main\"|\"night\"} [options.style=\"main\"] The base map style to be used.\n * @param {\"basic\"|\"hybrid\"|\"labels\"} [options.layer=\"basic\"] The base map's layer to be used.\n * @param {\"Unified\"|\"IN\"} [options.geopolView] Define the geopolitical view for the new map instance.\n * @param {Boolean|Object} [options.traffic] Allows to easily add the\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} and\n *     {{#crossLink \"L.TomTomTrafficIncidentsLayer\"}}{{/crossLink}} layers to the map.

If MapboxGL JS dependency is not met vector layer will not initialize.\n * @param {String} [options.glyphsUrl] Glyphs are fonts in PBF required to display labels on vector maps. The Url must\n * contain the {fontstack} and {range} tokens. The SDK distributable already contains the glyphs required by the default\n * vector styles - you just need to provide a path to them on your server.\n * Example of a URL format for this property:\n * ```javascript\n * \"http://yourdomain/glyphs/{fontstack}/{range}.pbf\"\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.basePath = '/sdk'] Base path for sdk, which will be used in relative paths.\n * E.g if you set this options to `\"/myPath\"`, default urls for styles will be set to `/myPath/styles/basic_main.json`\n * etc.\n * This property is used only if you do not provide custom mapping for given url mapping.\n * @param {Object} [options.styleUrlMapping] Overrides the default URLs for vector style files.\n * The default value is as follows:\n * ```javascript\n * {\n *   main: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_main.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_main.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_main.json'\n *   },\n *   night: {\n *      basic: '/sdk/styles/basic_night.json',\n *      hybrid: '/sdk/styles/hybrid_night.json',\n *      labels: '/sdk/styles/labels_night.json'\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n * @param {String} [options.spriteUrl] Set the base URL for the sprite image and metadata.

first argument and also\n * implement the \"go\" method which executed an arbitrary function passing all the property values.\n *\n * To create the getters and setters the first argument of the constructor should be an object with the\n * following accepted properties:\n *\n *  - name: String Custom name of the property. If isn't define the name of the property will be used.\n *  - validator: Function(value) If the value isn't valid this function should throw an Error,\n *      otherwise it should return the value validated\n *  - defaultValue: Function() This function have to return the default value\n *  - converter: Function(value) The returned value of this function will be used\n *\n * This is an example of configurations this module could take:\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {\n *     name: 'bestCity',\n *     validator: function (name) {\n *       if (typeof name !== 'string' || name.length === 0) throw new Error('City name is not valid');\n *       return name;\n *     },\n *     converter: function (name) {\n *       return name.toLowerCase();\n *     },\n *     defaultValue: function() {\n *       return 'Lodz';\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * var config = require('chain')(properties);\n * config.city(); // prints \"lodz\"\n * config.city('Torun'); // prints \"torun\"\n * config.city(); // prints \"torun\"\n * ```\n *\n * Take notice the converter function is always executed, even for the default value.\n *\n * As second argument a function will be expected and this function will be executed using the \"go\" method\n * returned by this constructor.\n * The additional functions returned by this constructor are: \"go\", \"callback\" and \"fail\".\n *\n * The \"go\" function will execute the function passed as second argument of the constructor which should\n * implement the next signature: goFunction(properties, callback) .\n *\n * Is expected that the \"goFunction\" will call the callback function available in the second argument which is the same\n * function defined in fields.callback or the first argument passed to the \"go\" function.\n *\n * The \"go\" method can receive two callback arguments: \"success\" and \"fail\" which will override the initial callbacks\n * defined during the creation and will be continue to be used in the next execution of the \"go\" function.\n *\n * If a callback is not provided nor in the fields.callback or as first argument of the \"go\" call,\n * then the \"go\" function will return a Promise, otherwise this function will return undefined.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * var properties = {\n *   city: {},\n *   country: {}\n * }\n * var defaults = {city: 'Lima', country: 'Peru'};\n * function sendToBackend(properties, callback) {\n *   // Ajax call sending the properties\n *   // ...\n *   callback(\"OK\");\n * }\n * function onSuccess() {};\n * function onfail() {};\n *\n * var config = require('chain')(properties, sendToBackend, defaults);\n *\n * // Calling \"go\" passing callbacks\n * config.go(onSuccess, onfail);\n *\n * // Calling go and receive a Promise\n * config.go()\n *   .then(onSuccess)\n *   .catch(onFail);\n * ```\n *\n * Do you think this was difficult to read? Believe me, the most difficult was to write it.\n * @private\n * @class Chain\n * @module Services\n * @constructor\n * @param {Object}   fields\n * @param {Function} fields.callback Default callback function to be executed by \"goFunction\" function\n * @param {Function} fields.fail Default fail function callback to be executed by \"goFunction\" function\n * @param {Function} [goFunction] Should have the signature: function(properties, callback): Promise|undefined\n * @param {Object}   [options] Object with the initial values for the properties defined in the \"fields\" argument\n * @param {Function} [options.fail] Failsafe \"fail\" function to be executed by \"goFunction\" callback argument.\n *                                  It will override \"fields.fail\" (yeah, don't ask me why)\n */\n\n/**\n * Executes a predefined asynchronous task using the current configuration and then execute one of\n * the callback functions based on the success of the result.\n *\n * It receives two optional arguments.

* If you don't specificy a failure callback, the default behavior in case of encounter a problem is to\n * throw an error.\n *\n * @example\n * ```js\n * function successCallback(results) {\n *
